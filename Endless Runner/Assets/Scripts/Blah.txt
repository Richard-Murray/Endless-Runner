-Get the players start Position (only once)
-Get the players update position (every single frame)

-if the distance between start position and there update position
< 50 pixels

-Generate a segment ahead
you make the start position = latest update position
and you repeat the process.

if the distance is < 25 pixels you delete the previous segment.
but for the first instance of the game you ignore this otherwise it will crash
